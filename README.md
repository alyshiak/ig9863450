# AI Based Content Generator

ImageGenie was created using AI technology which gives you the power to generate an image based off a simple prompt or to screen a tweet for discrimination of any kind.

# How to get best results with Vincent


- Use clear and specific language when describing the image you want to generate. The more detailed and specific your text, the better the image generated will be.

- Provide context for the image you want to generate. This can include information about the location, time period, or setting in which the image should be set.

- Use a variety of adjectives and descriptive words to give the engine a better understanding of the image you want to generate.

- Experiment with different text inputs and see how the engine responds. You may find that small changes in your text can result in big changes in the generated image.

- Be patient, Vincent uses DELL-E which a complex model that takes time to generate images and also it's not perfect, so don't expect a perfect image everytime.

- Adjust your input to improve image generation results.

# Limitations of Vincent


- Vincent uses machine learning and neural networks, which means that it may not always produce accurate or high-quality images.

- It can be prone to biases, as it is trained on a dataset that may contain biases.

- It is not capable of understanding the context behind the text input, so it may generate images that are not relevant or appropriate for the text provided.

- It not capable of understanding the real-world situations or common sense, so it may generate images that are unrealistic or impossible.

- Vincent uses DALL-E which is a newer model and is still being improved and developed, so there might be some limitations that will be addressed in the future.


# Limitations of TweetInspector


- TweetInspector uses OpenAI's machine learning model and neural networks, which means that it may not always produce accurate or coherent text.

- It can be prone to biases, as it is trained on a dataset that may contain biases.

- It is not capable of understanding the context behind the text input, so it may generate text that is not relevant or appropriate for the situation.

- It may struggle to understand idiomatic expressions, sarcasm or irony.

- It is not capable of understanding the emotions, sentiment or feelings behind the text input, so its analysis may not catch those.

# Roadmap

AI is evolving and so is our project. The future roadmap for ImageGenie includes several exciting developments and new features.

## Twitter API
In the near term, we plan to integrate our TwitterInspector with Twitter to provide better user experience. The application for the developers account has been approved and currently our team is working on exploring the ways in which we can incorporate the API into our application.

## Kafka
Kafka is an application that generates short stories with corresponding images. It allows users to input a short description of the story they would like to create, and the application generates a unique, engaging story with corresponding images that bring the narrative to life.

## Improving User interface

Additionally, we aim to make ImageGenie more accessible to a wider range of users by developing a user-friendly and intuitive interface and supporting multiple languages. We believe that by making the application more user-friendly, it will be easier for users to harness the power of AI to generate images and text for a variety of use cases.
